 * Using Telemetry, PPM and serial
 * The MX22's has a extra telemetry display added
 * For the MX22 if Devo or Walkera protocol is used we need to swap Collective and Throttle on a heli mode
 * but only needed if we fly the original Walkera electronics, for and
 * autopilot equiped aircraft we can do whatever we want with servo output, we are fully flexible then anyhow

     *  - If you put too big values compared to your TX you won't be able to reach the extremes which is bad for throttle as an example
     *  - If you put too low values you won't be able to use your full stick range, it will be maxed out before reaching the end
     *  - Centered stick value is usually 1500. It should match the middle between MIN and MAX, ie Center=(MAX-MIN)/2+MIN. If your TX is not centered you can adjust the value MIN or MAX.
     *  - 100% is the value when the model is by default, 125% is the value when you extend the servo travel which is only used by some protocols
